**universe**

What are we doing here?

The diameter of the observable universe is 93 billion light-years. (Wikipedia)

The age of the universe is about 13.7 billion years. (NASA)

“Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa” (Wikipedia)

The universe existed for billions of years before there were humans.

The average life expectancy in the United States is 77.28 years.

**entropy**

What is the relationship between entropy and living things?

A living thing increases order and decreases entropy, and this would seem to conflict with the second law of thermodynamics, but it doesn't because a living thing is not a closed system. In the process of using energy to create order within the organism, entropy is given off in the form of heat. Thus, the organism is able to create internal order even while the collective entropy of the universe continues to increase.

We, as living things, spend our entire lives in a fight against entropy. Without an input of energy into our bodies, entropy would have the matter that we are made up of be dispersed. Our forms are unstable. Could entropy be in a sort of fight against life and what makes life possible?
