**Subjective worlds??**

**What is love?, What is attention?**

Attention is the most basic form of love.

How love manifests is largely a matter of where you place your attention and how much energy is available to you to nourish your attention. Furthermore, love is about your habitual patterns of attention, resulting from how you’ve used your attention– intentionally or unintentionally–  in the past and thus where you are most easily able to place your attention now.

If attention is a form of love, then mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to what it is that you pay attention to, and moreover, noticing what it is that you are directing love towards.

Energy flows where attention goes.
