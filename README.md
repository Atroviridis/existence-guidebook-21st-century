Philosophical and spiritual inquiry in the 21st century

The goal of this project is
1) to bring together and elaborate upon ideas about human existence that can fit within a 21st century worldview in which science and empiricism are valued.
2) to express these ideas in as plain language as possible.
3) to make use of diverse sources (science, philosophy, world religions)
4) to build a coherent and unified worldview, showing how ideas connect in meaningful ways.
5) to find a form of spirituality that doesn’t oppose science.
6) to explore the interplay/relationship between the objective world as conceived by science and the subjective/personal world.

"At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes — an openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. - Carl Sagan

“We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith, because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of mind which is almost the opposite of faith. Belief, as I use the word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would “lief” or wish it to be. The believer will open his mind to the truth on the condition that it fits in with his preconceived ideas and wishes. Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be. Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown. Belief clings, but faith lets go. In this sense of the word, faith is the essential virtue of science and likewise of any religion that is not self-deception.” - Alan Watts
