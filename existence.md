**Existence**

The time is *now*, and you’ve become aware of a thought enter your mind: Why do I exist?

What happens when you approach this question with fresh eyes and with the utmost seriousness?

In asking this question, you realize the difficulty in even imagining what a coherent answer could ever possibly be. You don’t know what you want. You don't know what kind of answer would be satisfactory.

What is your earliest memory of noticing that you’re aware of your own existence? When did you first consider that time continually moves forward without ever stopping?

Did you take the next step? Did you juxtapose the fact of your existence with the thought that considers time in reverse searching for its beginning?

*You feel this movement of going back and back in time, perhaps forever, and then suddenly of jumping to arrive at yourself, right here and right now, in this very moment.*

***

Existence occurs spontaneously.

"It's only a matter of time before life begins."

You didn't choose to exist.

As far as you know, you don't exist of your own accord.

Life is given and can be taken away. 

One becomes aware of the fact of one's own existence only in retrospect.

Is your life your own?
