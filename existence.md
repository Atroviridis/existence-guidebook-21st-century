**Existence**

The time is *now*, and you’ve become aware of a thought enter your mind: Why do I exist?

What happens when you approach this question with fresh eyes and with the utmost seriousness?

In asking this question, you realize the difficulty in even imagining what a coherent answer could ever possibly be. You don’t know what you want. You don't know what kind of answer would be satisfactory.

What is your earliest memory of noticing that you’re aware of your own existence? When did you first consider that time continually moves forward without ever stopping?

Did you take the next step? Did you juxtapose the fact of your existence with the thought that considers time in reverse searching for its beginning?

*You feel this movement of going back and back in time, perhaps forever, and then suddenly of jumping to arrive at yourself, right here and right now, in this very moment.*

Does time have a beginning? If so, what was it like way back before time started? Back before there were trees and clouds and things?

Friedrich Nietzsche: “Glance into the world just as though time were gone: and everything crooked will become strait to you.”

We inhabit timelessness. What is the beginning of infinity?
