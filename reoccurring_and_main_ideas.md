Main ideas

1) The conflict between the finite and the infinite. This idea can manifest in multiple ways: as a desire for absolute certainty in various aspects of life when finitude entails uncertainty, not wanting to accept the fact of death, as a search for completeness and wholeness.

2) The conflict between self and world. Consciousness gives in the form of intentional action and receives in the form of spontaneous or unconscious action. This is sometimes called the conflict between the spirit and the flesh or the conflict between the intellect and nature. Zen Buddhism holds that fundamentally there is no conflict. Christianity emphasizes this conflict. Source: What is God? - Jacob Needleman - Zen and the Problem of Control - Alan Watts

3) Other people are reflections of yourself.
