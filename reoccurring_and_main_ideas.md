Main ideas

1) Existence occurs spontaneously. "It's only a matter of time before life begins." You didn't choose to exist. As far as you know, you don't exist of your own accord. Life is given and can be taken away. One becomes aware of the fact of one's own existence only in retrospect. Is your life your own?

2) What was before you were born and what will come after you die appear to have the same character about them, i.e. the complete unknown.

3) Life is change. Transience. Evanescence. Dynamic. In flux. There is no safety or security. Groundlessness.

4) The conflict between the finite and the infinite. This idea can manifest in multiple ways: as a desire for absolute certainty in various aspects of life when finitude entails uncertainty, not wanting to accept the fact of death, as a search for completeness and wholeness.

5) The conflict between self and world. Consciousness gives in the form of intentional action and receives in the form of spontaneous or unconscious action. This is sometimes called the conflict between the spirit and the flesh or the conflict between the intellect and nature. Zen Buddhism holds that fundamentally there is no conflict. Christianity emphasizes this conflict. Source: What is God? - Jacob Needleman - Zen and the Problem of Control - Alan Watts

6) Why do we so often seem to be unsatisfied with the present moment? "There" is no better than "here." When your "there" has become a "here," you will simply obtain another "there" that will again, look better than "here." Source: Ten Rules for Being Human

7) There is only ever the present moment. The mind collates moments into a narrative.

8) Other people are reflections of yourself. elaborate?
9) Against human exceptionalism. Agasint teleology? Humans are not central to some cosmic plan. Humans are not the pinnacle of creation. Humans are part of nature and not separate from it.
